This is a small library used for reading in Gromacs files (.xtc and .ndx) for
use in analyzing the results. This basically interfaces with libxdrfile and
implements an object-oriented style. The main usage of the library is to be able
to create a Trajectory object which reads in an XTC file along with an optional
GROMACS index file.
